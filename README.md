📊 Rent Affordability Trends in U.S. Cities (2015–2025)

This notebook explores historical rent trends across major U.S. cities using Zillow’s public ZORI dataset. I focused on cities I’ve lived in (Brooklyn, Oakland, SF, etc.) and those affected by pandemic-era migration (Portland, Miami, Seattle) to understand how affordability has shifted — especially after adjusting for inflation.

🛠 Skills demonstrated:
	•	Data cleaning & reshaping with pandas
	•	Inflation adjustment using the cpi package
	•	Data visualization with matplotlib & seaborn
	•	Communicating insights through storytelling

🧠 Key takeaways:
	•	Inflation-adjusted rents in West Coast cities like Oakland and SF have grown steadily since 2015, even after dips during COVID.
	•	Miami and Portland show more volatility, with pandemic years causing rapid swings.
	•	Adjusting for inflation meaningfully changes the perceived “spike” in recent rents — useful for both policymakers and renters.
