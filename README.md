📊 Rent Affordability Trends in U.S. Cities (2015–2025)

This notebook explores historical rent trends across major U.S. cities using Zillow’s public ZORI dataset. I focused on cities I’ve lived in (Brooklyn, Oakland, SF, etc.) and those affected by pandemic-era migration (Portland, Miami, Seattle) to understand how affordability has shifted — especially after adjusting for inflation.

**🛠 Skills demonstrated:**
- Data cleaning & reshaping with `pandas`
- Inflation adjustment using the `cpi` package
- Data visualization with `matplotlib` & `seaborn`
- Communicating insights through storytelling

**🧠 Key takeaways:**
- Inflation-adjusted rents in most HCOL cities have actually stayed steady, even after dips during COVID.
- Miami and SF have shown the most volatility, with SF's rents down almost a third from peak and Miami's up in a similar proportion.
- Adjusting for inflation meaningfully changes the perceived “spike” in recent rents — useful for both policymakers and renters.
